### Hi I'm an algorithm to dispatch pizza delivery instructions for either 1 or 2 delivery people.

### To run my unit tests:
1. You will need Node version 0.10+ 
2. Install testem `npm install testem -g`
3. Type `testem` on your terminal
4. Follow the instructions on your terminal

### Answers
1. Given the string of dispatcher inputs attached to this gist, how many houses receive at least one pizza?
<b>2565</b> with 1 delivery person
2. Given the same string of dispatcher inputs as in Part One, how many houses receive at least one pizza?
<b>2639</b> with 2 delivery person
